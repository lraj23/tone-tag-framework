# Tone Tag Framework

### Main Purpose

This bot is designed to help people using tone tags with using them (sort of)! Including a tone tag in your message in a channel with the bot will prompt it to ask you if you want to include said tone tag's warning in the channel.

### Theme Explanation

The theme for this week was `framework`, which honestly doesn't seem very obviously fitting for this project beyonds its name. The way this project fits the theme `framework` is in that when a tone tag warning is added, it creates a "framework" around the message sent. (Yes I'm hanging on by a thread here.)

### Commands

There are a LOT of commands on this bot because of all the tone tags!

#### /ttframework-help
This command gives some information about this bot, but isn't really useful.

#### /ttframework-edit-opts
This command allows you to opt out of tone tag warnings, or allows you to automatically send a tone tag warning instead of asking every time!

#### /ttframework-\<tone tag\>
This command lets you send a message with a tone tag that automatically includes the tone tag warning. The tone tags supported are /j, /srs, /silly, /sarc, /hj, and /hsrs.

#### /\<tone tag\>
This command is the same as above, and simply exists in case someone accidentally runs the command instead of sending the tone tag as a message.
